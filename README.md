# Mount & Abyss (in development)
Prepare for an epic adventure in "Mount & Abyss," a dynamic 2D platformer where players journey through two starkly contrasting worlds: the towering, snow-capped mountains above and the dark, treacherous abyss below.

Conquer the Mountain Heights: Start your adventure high above the clouds in a world of soaring peaks and floating platforms. Traverse rugged terrain, leap across crumbling brick pathways, and outsmart quirky, cube-like enemies with sinister faces. The mountain world is filled with both beauty and danger, requiring quick reflexes, precise jumps, and strategic thinking to navigate its heights and avoid its traps.

Descend into the Abyss: When the challenge above isn't enough, descend into the ominous depths of the Abyss. This shadowy realm is filled with towering fortresses, molten rivers, and eerie banners that tell of forgotten tales. Here, the stakes are higher, and the enemies are tougher, demanding skill and strategy to survive. Each step deeper into the Abyss brings new dangers and mysteries to unravel.

### Key Features:
- Dual-World Gameplay: Experience two distinct environments with unique platforming challenges and enemies.
- Engaging Enemy Encounters: Face diverse foes, each bringing fresh challenges that keep players on their toes.
- Stunning Pixel Art: Immerse yourself in beautifully crafted pixel art that vividly depicts the serene yet treacherous mountain heights and the dark, foreboding depths of the Abyss.

- Dive into "Mount & Abyss," where the path from the mountain's peak to the heart of the abyss is filled with peril, discovery, and adventure. Only the bravest will survive the journey between the two worlds and unveil their hidden mysteries.
